comicCanvas
===========

HTML5 canvas project for viewing comic books. The goal is to have one canvas object that can call different comic books using a JSON file for instructions. There are two examples in this project.

Ideally, comics will be visually designed to take advantage of a wide screen ration, as opposed to the vertical layout of a printed page.
